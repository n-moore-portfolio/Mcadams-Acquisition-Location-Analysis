# Mcadams-Acquisition-Location-Analysis

This is an Exploratory Data Analysis for the best locations to acquire a CE firm. Currently, Mcadams is looking to grow its size and revenue, so this project takes into account many variables that are important in the decision-making process.

This repository consists of:
- web scrapers for data collection
- data cleaning files
- a final analysis file
- a tableau workbook file

Please view the final analysis file and tableau workbook to read the insights of the project. Thank you.
